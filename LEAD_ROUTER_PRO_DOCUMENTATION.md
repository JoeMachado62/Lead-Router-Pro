### **Recommendation:**
These files served their purpose during development and debugging but are no longer needed for production operation. They can be safely deleted to clean up the codebase, with the understanding that they provided valuable debugging and setup functionality during development.

**Files to Keep:**
All core application files, configuration files, templates, documentation, and the main service modules should be retained as they are essential for system operation.
