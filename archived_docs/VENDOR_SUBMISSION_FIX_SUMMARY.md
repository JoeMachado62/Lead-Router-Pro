# Vendor Submission Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Coverage Type Not Stored**: The `coverage_type` field from the vendor widget was being sent but not stored in the database
2. **State Abbreviations Not Mapped**: When selecting states (e.g., "Florida"), the widget correctly sent state codes (e.g., "FL") but they weren't being stored in the `coverage_states` field
3. **Service Categories Confusion**: The widget sends both `service_categories` (e.g., "Boat Maintenance") and `services_provided` (e.g., "Boat Detailing"), but they were being mixed up during processing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Layer (simple_connection.py)
- Updated `create_vendor` method to accept `coverage_type` and `coverage_states` parameters
- Added proper parameter passing for complete vendor data storage

### 2. Webhook Handler (webhook_routes.py)
- Added proper extraction and processing of `coverage_type` from form payload
- Added handling for `coverage_states` with support for both array and comma-separated formats
- Fixed separation of `service_categories` (categories) vs `services_provided` (specific services)
- Updated vendor creation calls to pass all coverage-related fields

### 3. Field Mapping Logic
- Clarified that `service_categories` contains category names like "Boat Maintenance, Engines and Generators"
- Clarified that `services_provided` contains specific service names like "Boat Detailing, Ceramic Coating"
- Properly maps coverage data based on coverage type selection

## How the Fix Works

When a vendor submits the form with:
- Coverage Type: "state"
- States Selected: Florida
- Categories: "Boat Maintenance", "Engines and Generators"
- Services: "Boat Detailing", "Ceramic Coating", etc.

The system now correctly:
1. Stores `coverage_type` as "state"
2. Stores `coverage_states` as ["FL"]
3. Stores `service_categories` as ["Boat Maintenance", "Engines and Generators"]
4. Stores `services_offered` as ["Boat Detailing", "Ceramic Coating", ...]

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_vendor_submission_fix.py
```

Then check the vendor data:
```bash
python check_vendor_data.py <ghl_contact_id>
```

## Vendor Widget (vendor_widget.html)

The widget was already correctly collecting and sending the data. The issues were in the backend processing. No changes were needed to the widget itself.
