# DockSide Pros Lead Router - Setup Guide

## üéØ MVP Implementation Complete!

This guide will help you deploy and configure the DockSide Pros Lead Router MVP for automatic lead assignment.

## üìã What's Included

### Core Components
- **`lead_router.py`** - Main lead routing logic with vendor matching
- **`webhook_server.py`** - Flask web server to handle Elementor webhooks
- **`config.py`** - Configuration management
- **`test_system.py`** - Comprehensive system testing
- **`ghl_field_creator.py`** - Custom field creation (already working)

### Deployment Files
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`deploy.sh`** - Automated VPS deployment script
- **`.env.example`** - Environment configuration template

## üöÄ Quick Start (Development)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual GHL credentials
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
python test_system.py
```

### 4. Start the Webhook Server
```bash
python webhook_server.py
```

### 5. Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/test
```

## üèóÔ∏è Production Deployment

### Option 1: Automated VPS Deployment
```bash
# On your VPS (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo chmod +x deploy.sh
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. **Install Python 3.8+**
2. **Create virtual environment**
3. **Install dependencies**
4. **Configure nginx reverse proxy**
5. **Set up systemd service**
6. **Configure SSL certificate**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps

### 1. GoHighLevel Setup

#### A. Get Pipeline and Stage IDs
1. Go to your GHL account ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pipelines
2. Find your marine services pipeline
3. Copy the pipeline ID and stage IDs
4. Update `.env` file:
```env
PIPELINE_ID=your_actual_pipeline_id
NEW_LEAD_STAGE_ID=your_new_lead_stage_id
```

#### B. Verify Custom Fields
Your custom fields are already created! The system uses:

**For Leads (Clients):**
- `specific_service_needed`
- `zip_code_of_service`
- `service_category`
- `vessel_make`, `vessel_model`, `vessel_year`
- `special_requests__notes`

**For Vendors:**
- `services_provided`
- `service_zip_codes`
- `taking_new_work`
- `ghl_user_id`
- `last_lead_assigned`
- `vendor_company_name`

#### C. Set Up Vendor Contacts
For each vendor in GHL, ensure these fields are populated:
```
Services Provided: "Boat Maintenance, Engines and Generators"
Service Zip Codes: "33101, 33102, 33103"
Taking New Work?: "Yes"
GHL User ID: "user_id_from_ghl"
```

### 2. Elementor Forms Setup

#### A. Add Webhook to Forms
1. Edit your Elementor form
2. Go to Actions After Submit
3. Add "Webhook" action
4. Set webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/elementor`

#### B. Form Field Mapping
Ensure your forms have these field names (or similar):
- `name` or `full_name`
- `email` or `email_address`
- `phone` or `phone_number`
- `service` or `service_type`
- `zip_code` or `postal_code`
- `message` or `special_requests`

#### C. Form Source Identification
Set form names to help with service classification:
- `boat-detailing`
- `engine-repair`
- `yacht-welding`
- `ac-repair`
- etc.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Tests
- [ ] GHL API connection works
- [ ] Vendor detection finds your vendors
- [ ] Service classification works correctly
- [ ] Lead processing creates contacts
- [ ] Webhook server responds to requests

### Post-Deployment Tests
- [ ] Webhook URL is accessible from internet
- [ ] SSL certificate is working
- [ ] Form submissions create leads in GHL
- [ ] Leads are assigned to correct vendors
- [ ] Vendor assignment timestamps update

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "No vendors found"
**Cause:** Vendor contacts missing required fields
**Solution:** 
- Check vendor contacts have `services_provided` field
- Ensure `taking_new_work` is set to "Yes"
- Verify `service_zip_codes` are populated

#### 2. "Service type not classified"
**Cause:** Form data doesn't match service mappings
**Solution:**
- Check form field names match expected values
- Add custom mappings in `lead_router.py`
- Verify form source names

#### 3. "Failed to create contact"
**Cause:** GHL API issues or missing required fields
**Solution:**
- Check GHL API credentials
- Verify required fields (name, email) are present
- Check GHL API rate limits

#### 4. "Webhook not receiving data"
**Cause:** Network/firewall issues
**Solution:**
- Check server is running on correct port
- Verify firewall allows incoming connections
- Test with curl or Postman

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status lead-router

# View logs
tail -f /var/log/lead-router/webhook.log

# Test webhook locally
python test_system.py

# Check nginx configuration
nginx -t

# Restart services
systemctl restart lead-router nginx
```

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Lead processing success rate
- Vendor assignment distribution
- Response times
- Error rates

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor vendor "taking new work" status
- Update service mappings as needed
- Review and clean up test leads
- Check system logs for errors

## üîÑ Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Improvements
- [ ] Vendor performance scoring
- [ ] Advanced service classification (AI)
- [ ] Customer feedback integration
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Mobile notifications for vendors

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Database for lead history
- [ ] Redis for caching
- [ ] Load balancing for high traffic
- [ ] Automated vendor onboarding

### Key Files for Customization
- **Service Mappings:** `lead_router.py` ‚Üí `_load_service_mappings()`
- **Vendor Logic:** `lead_router.py` ‚Üí `find_matching_vendors()`
- **Form Processing:** `webhook_server.py` ‚Üí `extract_form_data()`

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your MVP is successful when:
- [ ] 90% of form submissions are properly routed
- [ ] Lead assignment happens within 30 seconds
- [ ] Vendors receive leads fairly distributed
- [ ] Zero manual lead routing required
- [ ] System runs reliably 24/7

## üéâ Congratulations!

You now have a fully functional lead routing system that will:
1. **Automatically receive** leads from Elementor forms
2. **Classify service types** based on form data
3. **Match vendors** by service and location
4. **Assign leads fairly** using round-robin
5. **Create contacts and opportunities** in GoHighLevel
6. **Track assignment history** for reporting

The system is ready for production use and will significantly reduce manual lead routing work while ensuring fair distribution to your vendor network.
