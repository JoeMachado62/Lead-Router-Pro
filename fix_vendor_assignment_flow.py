Fix script to correct the vendor assignment flow in webhook_routes.py
This script identifies the key issues and provides the fixes needed.

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Vendor pre-selection happens BEFORE opportunity creation (backwards)
2. Lead is created WITHOUT opportunity_id initially
3. Vendor assignment logic is scattered and not triggered properly
4. No support for preferred vendor from form submission

CORRECT FLOW:
1. Create GHL contact
2. Create opportunity FIRST
3. Create lead WITH opportunity_id
4. Trigger vendor selection based on lead data
5. Update lead with vendor_id
6. Update GHL opportunity with vendor's GHL User ID

1. In trigger_clean_lead_routing_workflow function:
   
   OLD ORDER:
   - Create lead (without opportunity_id)
   - Create opportunity
   - Try to assign pre-selected vendor
   
   NEW ORDER:
   - Create opportunity FIRST
   - Create lead WITH opportunity_id
   - Trigger vendor selection based on lead data
   - Update opportunity with selected vendor

2. Remove pre-selection logic from main webhook handler

3. Add new function for vendor assignment:
   async def assign_vendor_to_lead(lead_id, opportunity_id, service, location):
       # Find matching vendors
       # Select vendor via algorithm
       # Update lead with vendor_id
       # Update GHL opportunity with vendor's GHL User ID

4. Update lead status to track assignment:
   - "pending_assignment" - awaiting vendor selection
   - "assigned" - vendor selected and notified
   - "unassigned" - no vendors available
