## What the Lead Router Does with Vendor Data

### 1. üîÑ Data Processing & Validation

**Field Mapping & Normalization:**
- Maps form field names to GHL custom field IDs using `field_mapper` service
- Normalizes phone numbers, email addresses, and ZIP codes
- Validates required fields (email, firstName, lastName, vendor_company_name)
- Converts service areas into searchable format

**Data Enrichment:**
- Adds source tracking ("Vendor Application Form (DSP)")
- Applies appropriate tags for categorization
- Timestamps all submissions for audit trails

### 2. üìä GoHighLevel Integration

### 3. üóÑÔ∏è Internal Database Storage

**Vendor Record Creation:**
```sql
INSERT INTO vendors (
  account_id,
  name,
  email,
  phone,
  company_name,
  services_offered,
  service_areas,
  ghl_contact_id,
  status,
  performance_score,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  'account_uuid',
  'Michael Rodriguez',
  'mike@marineprosolutions.com',
  '+1-305-555-0123',
  'Marine Pro Solutions LLC',
  '["Boat Maintenance", "Marine Systems", "Engine Service"]',
  '["33139", "33140", "33141", "33154", "33155", "33156"]',
  'ghl_contact_id_from_api',
  'pending_approval',
  0.0,
  '2025-01-15 10:30:00'
);
```

**Service Category Mapping:**

- Maps to standardized service categories:
  - "Boat Maintenance" ‚Üí `boat_maintenance`
  - "Marine Systems" ‚Üí `marine_systems`

- Enables location-based vendor matching for leads

### 4. üéØ Lead Routing Integration

**Vendor Pool Management:**
```python
# When a lead comes in for "Boat Maintenance" in ZIP 33139:
matching_vendors = lead_routing_service.find_matching_vendors(
    account_id=account_id,
    service_category="Boat Maintenance",
    zip_code="33139",
    priority="normal"
)
# Returns: [Marine Pro Solutions LLC, other matching vendors]
