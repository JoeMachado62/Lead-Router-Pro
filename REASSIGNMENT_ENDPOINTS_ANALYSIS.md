# Lead Reassignment Endpoints Analysis

## Summary
Both endpoints exist and serve different purposes, but they have issues that need to be fixed to work with the corrected vendor assignment flow.

## Endpoint 1: `/api/v1/webhooks/ghl/reassign-lead`
**File:** `api/routes/webhook_routes.py` (line 2799)
**Purpose:** GHL workflow webhook for reassigning leads when triggered by tags

### Current Functionality:
1. Validates webhook API key
2. Receives contact_id and optional opportunity_id from GHL
3. Fetches contact details from GHL
4. Creates or finds existing lead in database
5. Finds matching vendors (excluding previous vendor)
6. Assigns to new vendor
7. Updates/creates opportunity with vendor assignment

### Issues Found:
- **Still uses old flow** - Creates lead without opportunity_id if opportunity doesn't exist
- **Inconsistent with new flow** - Doesn't follow the corrected order (opportunity → lead → vendor)
- **Missing opportunity creation** - Only updates if opportunity exists, creates new one afterwards
- **Database schema issues** - Uses some deprecated fields

## Endpoint 2: `/api/v1/reassignment/lead` 
**File:** `api/routes/lead_reassignment.py` (line 39)
**Purpose:** REST API endpoint for programmatic lead reassignment

### Current Functionality:
1. Accepts contact_id and optional lead_id
2. Fetches contact from GHL
3. Finds or creates lead record
4. Uses routing service to find new vendor (excludes previous)
5. Updates lead record with new vendor
6. Updates GHL contact custom fields (NOT opportunity)
7. Logs reassignment events

### Issues Found:
- **NO opportunity handling** - Completely ignores opportunities
- **Doesn't update GHL opportunity** - Only updates contact custom fields
- **Creates incomplete leads** - Missing critical fields like opportunity_id
- **Uses old database methods** - Some methods may not exist
- **Poor account handling** - Hacky way of getting account info

## Key Differences:

| Feature | `/webhooks/ghl/reassign-lead` | `/reassignment/lead` |
|---------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Trigger** | GHL workflow (tags) | API call |
| **Auth** | Webhook API key | None specified |
| **Opportunity** | Updates/creates | Ignores completely |
| **Contact Update** | No | Yes (custom fields) |
| **Event Logging** | Basic activity log | Detailed event history |
| **Response** | Simple JSON | Structured model |
| **Bulk Support** | No | Yes |

## Problems with Current Implementation:

1. **Neither follows the corrected flow**: 
   - Should be: Create opportunity → Create lead with opportunity_id → Assign vendor
   - Both endpoints do it differently and incorrectly

2. **Inconsistent opportunity handling**:
   - First endpoint partially handles opportunities
   - Second endpoint completely ignores them

3. **No opportunity assignment in second endpoint**:
   - Updates contact custom fields instead of opportunity assignedTo
   - This means vendor assignment won't show in GHL pipeline

4. **Database inconsistency**:
   - Creates leads without proper opportunity_ids
   - Missing required fields for vendor matching

## Recommendations:

### Option 1: Consolidate into One Endpoint
Create a single, robust reassignment endpoint that:
- Handles both webhook and API calls
- Always ensures opportunity exists
- Follows correct flow (opportunity → lead → vendor)
- Updates both database and GHL properly

### Option 2: Fix Both Endpoints
Update both to:
1. Use the new `assign_vendor_to_lead()` function
2. Ensure opportunity exists before lead creation
3. Properly update GHL opportunity assignedTo field
4. Follow consistent flow

### Option 3: Specialized Endpoints (Recommended)
Keep both but with clear purposes:

**`/webhooks/ghl/reassign-lead`** - For GHL Workflows
- Lightweight webhook receiver
- Delegates to core reassignment logic
- Returns simple success/fail

**`/reassignment/lead`** - For API/Admin Use
- Full-featured REST endpoint
- Supports bulk operations
- Returns detailed responses
- Includes history tracking

## Proposed Fix Implementation:

### Core Reassignment Function
```python
async def reassign_lead_core(
    contact_id: str,
    exclude_previous: bool = True,
    reason: str = "reassignment"
) -> Dict:
    """
    Core logic for lead reassignment that both endpoints can use.
    Follows correct flow: ensure opportunity → ensure lead → reassign vendor
    """
    # 1. Get contact from GHL
    # 2. Find or create opportunity
    # 3. Find or create lead WITH opportunity_id
    # 4. Find new vendor (exclude previous if requested)
    # 5. Update lead with new vendor
    # 6. Update GHL opportunity assignedTo
    # 7. Log reassignment event
    return result
```

### Then Update Both Endpoints:
- Webhook endpoint: Simple wrapper around core function
- API endpoint: Add validation, bulk support, history around core function

## Impact on Existing System:
- Both endpoints need significant updates
- Database queries need to be verified
- GHL API calls need to use v2 optimized client
- Ensure compatibility with new vendor assignment flow
