# Enhanced Lead Routing System Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive enhancement to the Lead Router Pro system that transforms it from a simple ZIP code-based routing system to an intelligent, scalable, and performance-driven lead distribution platform.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Geographic Coverage System
- **Global Coverage**: Vendors can serve worldwide
- **National Coverage**: Vendors serve entire United States
- **State Coverage**: Vendors serve one or more specific states
- **County Coverage**: Vendors serve specific counties
- **ZIP Code Coverage**: Legacy support for existing ZIP code vendors

### 2. Dual Routing Logic
- **Round-Robin Routing**: Distributes leads based on `last_lead_assigned` timestamp
- **Performance-Based Routing**: Prioritizes vendors with highest `lead_close_percentage`
- **Configurable Distribution**: Admins can set percentage split (0-100%) between methods
- **Tie-Breaking**: Performance routing falls back to round-robin for tied vendors

### 3. Enhanced Vendor Matching
- **Service Category Matching**: Intelligent keyword-based service matching
- **Location Coverage Verification**: Ensures vendors can serve the requested area
- **Status Filtering**: Only active vendors taking new work are considered
- **Priority Handling**: Support for emergency/high-priority requests

## Database Schema Changes

### New Vendor Fields Added
```sql
-- Service coverage configuration
service_coverage_type TEXT DEFAULT 'zip'  -- 'global', 'national', 'state', 'county', 'zip'
service_states TEXT DEFAULT '[]'          -- JSON array of state abbreviations
service_counties TEXT DEFAULT '[]'        -- JSON array of "County, ST" format

-- Performance tracking
last_lead_assigned TIMESTAMP              -- For round-robin logic
lead_close_percentage REAL DEFAULT 0.0    -- For performance-based routing
```

### Account Settings
- `lead_routing_performance_percentage`: Controls routing distribution (0-100%)

## Core Services Implemented

### 1. LocationService (`api/services/location_service.py`)
- **ZIP Code Lookup**: Converts ZIP codes to state/county/city information
- **Coverage Validation**: Checks if ZIP codes fall within vendor coverage areas
- **Geographic Utilities**: Provides coverage summaries and validation

**Key Methods:**
- `zip_to_location(zip_code)`: Primary lookup function
- `is_zip_in_coverage_area()`: Coverage validation
- `get_coverage_summary()`: Human-readable coverage descriptions

### 2. LeadRoutingService (`api/services/lead_routing_service.py`)
- **Enhanced Vendor Matching**: Finds all vendors that can serve a location
- **Dual Routing Selection**: Implements round-robin vs performance-based logic
- **Configuration Management**: Handles routing percentage settings

**Key Methods:**
- `find_matching_vendors()`: Enhanced vendor discovery
- `select_vendor_from_pool()`: Intelligent vendor selection
- `update_routing_configuration()`: Admin configuration updates

## Integration Points

### 1. Webhook Routes Updated
- Enhanced `find_matching_vendors()` calls now use `lead_routing_service`
- Vendor selection uses `select_vendor_from_pool()` with dual routing logic
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing webhook endpoints

### 2. GHL Field Integration
Based on your field_reference.json:
- **Lead Close %**: `contact.lead_close_` (ID: `OwHQipU7xdrHCpVswtnW`)
- **Last Lead Assigned**: Tracked in database and synced with GHL

### 3. Database Migration
- Automatic column addition for existing databases
- Backward compatibility with existing vendor records
- Default values ensure smooth transition

## Vendor Coverage Examples

### Global Vendor
```json
{
  "service_coverage_type": "global",
  "service_states": [],
  "service_counties": []
}
```

### State-Level Vendor
```json
{
  "service_coverage_type": "state", 
  "service_states": ["FL", "GA", "SC"],
  "service_counties": []
}
```

### County-Level Vendor
```json
{
  "service_coverage_type": "county",
  "service_states": [],
  "service_counties": ["Broward, FL", "Miami-Dade, FL", "Palm Beach, FL"]
}
```

## Routing Logic Flow

### 1. Lead Comes In
1. Extract ZIP code from lead data
2. Convert ZIP to state/county using LocationService
3. Find all eligible vendors using enhanced matching

### 2. Vendor Pool Creation
1. Filter by service category match
2. Filter by active status and availability
3. Filter by geographic coverage
4. Result: Pool of eligible vendors

### 3. Vendor Selection
1. Get account routing configuration (% performance vs round-robin)
2. Randomly decide routing method based on percentage
3. Apply selected method:
   - **Round-Robin**: Select vendor with oldest `last_lead_assigned`
   - **Performance**: Select vendor with highest `lead_close_percentage`
4. Update selected vendor's `last_lead_assigned` timestamp

## Admin Dashboard Integration (Ready for Implementation)

### Lead Routing Widget Specifications
- **Animated Slider**: Drag between Round Robin (left) and Performance Based (right)
- **Real-time Percentages**: Shows current distribution split
- **Immediate Updates**: Saves configuration to database instantly
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current routing strategy

### Implementation Location
- Add to vendor management section of dashboard
- Widget title: "Lead Routing Distribution"
- API endpoint: `/api/v1/routing/configuration` (ready to implement)

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Scalability
- Supports vendors from local county coverage to global operations
- No longer limited by ZIP code management overhead
- Easy to add new geographic coverage types

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Merit-based routing rewards high-performing vendors
- Configurable balance between fairness and performance
- Automatic tie-breaking ensures consistent behavior

### 3. Flexibility
- Admins can adjust routing strategy in real-time
- Supports emergency/priority routing
- Backward compatible with existing ZIP code vendors

### 4. Intelligence
- Geographic coverage validation prevents misrouted leads
- Service category matching reduces irrelevant assignments
- Performance tracking enables data-driven decisions
