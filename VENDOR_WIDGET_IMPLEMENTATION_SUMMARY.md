# Vendor Widget Implementation Summary

## Overview
The vendor application widget has been fully enhanced with a multi-step category and service selection flow that properly captures primary and additional service offerings.

## Multi-Step Flow Implementation

### Step 1: Primary Category Selection
- **Single select dropdown** showing all available service categories
- User must select ONE primary category (e.g., "Engines and Generators")
- This becomes their main area of expertise

### Step 2: Primary Services Selection
- **Dynamic service list** based on the selected primary category
- Shows ONLY services from the primary category
- Multi-select checkboxes allow selecting specific services
- Example: If "Engines and Generators" selected, shows:
  - Outboard Engine Service
  - Inboard Engine Service
  - Generator Service and Repair
  - Diesel Engine Service

### Step 3: Additional Categories Selection (Optional)
- **Multi-select checkboxes** for up to 2 additional categories
- Primary category is EXCLUDED from this list
- User can skip this step if they only offer services in one category
- Example: User can add "Boat Maintenance" and "Marine Systems"

### Step 4: Additional Services Selection
- **Only appears if** user selected additional categories in Step 3
- **Dynamically populated** with services from EACH selected additional category
- Services are grouped by category for clarity
- Example display:
  ```
  Boat Maintenance:
  ☐ Boat Detailing
  ☐ Ceramic Coating
  ☐ Yacht Fire Detection Systems
  
  Marine Systems:
  ☐ Yacht AC Service
  ☐ Boat Electrical Service
  ☐ Yacht Plumbing
  ```

## Data Structure

### Form Submission Payload
The form now sends both separated and combined data:

```javascript
{
  // Separated fields for precise tracking
  "primary_service_category": "Engines and Generators",
  "primary_services": "Outboard Engine Service, Generator Service and Repair",
  "additional_categories": "Boat Maintenance, Marine Systems",
  "additional_services": "Boat Detailing, Yacht AC Service, Boat Electrical Service",
  
  // Combined fields for database storage
  "service_categories": "Engines and Generators, Boat Maintenance, Marine Systems",
  "services_provided": "Outboard Engine Service, Generator Service and Repair, Boat Detailing, Yacht AC Service, Boat Electrical Service",
  
  // Other vendor fields...
}
```

### Database Storage
- **vendors.primary_service_category**: Stores the primary category separately
- **vendors.service_categories**: Stores all categories (primary + additional) as JSON
- **vendors.services_offered**: Stores all selected services as JSON

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Service Loading
```javascript
// Services are dynamically loaded based on selected categories
const services = SERVICE_CATEGORIES[category] || [];
```

### 2. State Management
```javascript
const widgetState = {
    primaryCategory: '',          // Single primary category
    primaryServices: new Set(),   // Services from primary category
    additionalCategories: new Set(), // Up to 2 additional categories
    additionalServices: new Set(),   // Services from additional categories
    currentStep: 1,
    formData: {},
    coverageType: '',
    debugMode: false
};
```

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bar shows completion percentage
- Steps are validated before allowing progression
- Draft saving preserves multi-step selections

### 4. Field Validation
- Primary category is required
- At least one service must be selected
- Additional categories are optional
- Maximum of 2 additional categories enforced

## Testing

### Test Script: `test_vendor_widget_flow.html`
A comprehensive test page that:
- Visualizes the complete multi-step flow
- Shows expected vs actual behavior
- Demonstrates different selection scenarios
- Displays the final payload structure

### API Test: `test_complete_vendor_flow.py`
Python script that tests the webhook endpoint with:
- All required fields properly named
- Multi-step selection data
- Field validation testing

## Backend Integration

### Webhook Handler Updates
The `webhook_routes.py` file properly processes:
- Primary category stored separately in database
- Services combined from all sources
- Backward compatibility maintained
- All fields mapped to correct GHL custom field IDs

### Database Updates
- Added `primary_service_category` column to vendors table
- Updated `create_vendor` method to accept new fields
- Automatic schema migration on first use

## Usage Instructions

1. **Embed the Widget**
   ```html
   <iframe src="https://your-domain.com/vendor_widget.html" 
           width="100%" 
           height="800" 
           frameborder="0">
   </iframe>
   ```

2. **Configure API Endpoint**
   Update line 1793 in vendor_widget.html:
   ```javascript
   const apiUrl = 'https://your-domain.com/api/v1/webhooks/elementor/vendor_application';
   ```

3. **Test the Flow**
   - Open `test_vendor_widget_flow.html` in a browser
   - Run the different test scenarios
   - Verify the payload structure

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Clear Service Hierarchy**: Primary category is distinguished from additional offerings
2. **Flexible Selection**: Vendors can offer services across multiple categories
3. **User-Friendly Flow**: Step-by-step process prevents overwhelming the user
4. **Data Integrity**: Separate tracking of primary vs additional services
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Combined fields ensure existing integrations work

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production server
2. Test with real vendor submissions
3. Monitor webhook logs for any issues
4. Consider adding service count limits per category
5. Add analytics to track most popular category combinations
