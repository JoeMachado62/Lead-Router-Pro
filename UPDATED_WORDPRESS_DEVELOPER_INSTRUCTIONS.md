# Updated WordPress Developer Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS

The webhook system has been **significantly updated** to fix payload processing issues. The main changes are:

### 1. **Custom Fields Now Use Array Format**
- The system now properly processes custom fields using GoHighLevel's official `customFields` array format
- **Field names remain exactly the same** - no changes needed to your Elementor forms
- The middleware automatically converts individual field properties to the proper array format

### 2. **All Custom Fields Are Now Mapped**
- All custom fields from your previous instructions are confirmed to exist in the system
- Field validation is now more robust with proper error handling

### 3. **New Vendor Application Forms Added**
